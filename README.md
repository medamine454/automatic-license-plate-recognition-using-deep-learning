# automatic license plate recognition using deep learning
Automated license plate recognition, also known as ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition), is a technology designed to identify vehicle license plates through the use of optical character recognition techniques. This system is used to identify and register all the vehicles that enter or leave the parking lot, obtaining a great control of the vehicles license plates and therefore an increased security.
